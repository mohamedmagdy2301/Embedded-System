### 1. **Introduction to Embedded Systems**
   - **Definition**: An embedded system is a hardware/software system that responds to environmental events. The software is embedded directly into the hardware, usually as a real-time system.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Continuously operating with no termination.
     - Unpredictable environmental interactions.
     - May face physical limitations (e.g., power).
     - Direct hardware interaction required.
     - Safety and reliability are key design considerations.

### 2. **Reactive Systems**
   - **Stimulus and Response**: Must react to stimuli within specific timeframes.
   - **Types of Stimuli**:
     - *Periodic*: Occurs at regular intervals (e.g., temperature polling).
     - *Aperiodic*: Occurs unpredictably (e.g., power failure interrupt).

### 3. **Responsiveness in Real-Time Systems**
   - Critical for embedded systems; timeliness affects correctness.
   - Distinguishes embedded systems from general software systems.

### 4. **Model of Embedded Real-Time Systems**
   - **Components**:
     - *Sensors*: Convert physical data to electrical signals (e.g., thermometer).
     - *Actuators*: Convert electrical signals to physical changes (e.g., motors).
   - **Process Structure**:
     - Sensor control, data processing, and actuator control.

### 5. **Architectural Patterns for Embedded Systems**
   - **Observe and React**: Monitors sensor data and triggers alarms if thresholds are exceeded.
   - **Environmental Control**: Adjusts actuators based on environmental data.
   - **Process Pipeline**: Sequentially processes data in a pipeline, useful in data acquisition systems.

### 6. **Real-Time System Modeling and Timing Analysis**
   - **State Models**: Useful for modeling state transitions in embedded systems.
   - **Timing Requirements**: Analysis ensures processes respond in a timely manner to meet system requirements.

### 7. **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**
   - Specialized OS for managing real-time processes.
   - Key Components:
     - Real-time clock, interrupt handler, scheduler, resource manager, dispatcher.

### 8. **Priority and Interrupt Handling in RTOS**
   - **Process Priority Levels**:
     - Interrupt level (highest), clock level, and further subdivided as needed.
   - **Interrupt Servicing**: Quick and efficient interrupt management is essential.

### Summary
Embedded systems are real-time systems that operate continuously and require timely responses to environmental changes. They integrate hardware and software, often following specific architectural patterns, such as Observe and React or Environmental Control, to manage sensor data and actuate responses. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) prioritize processes and manage resources to ensure efficient, time-sensitive operations.
